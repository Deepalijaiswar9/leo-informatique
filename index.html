          <h3>About Us</h3>

          <p>Leo Infotech first began in 1992 in the form of Leo Systems – founded by Abid Ginwala and later joined by
            Asif Surangiwala, both of them Electronics Engineers. With an extensive background of computer architecture
            and industry knowledge, Leo Systems set about creating a business through which to channel their knowledge
            to help the ordinary person better interact with their computing investment by allowing the system to reach
            it’s full potential. This involved both software and hardware troubleshooting and regular maintenance</p>
          <p>Eventually the business grew to a point where expansion was necessary and the decision was made in 1995 to
            transfer to a new company Leo Infotech. Leo Infotech (LI) offered Sales, Service and Repair on all makes of
            Desktop and Laptop Computers. By dealing honestly with customers, taking an after the sale customer service
            focus, and guaranteeing same day service, LI has established its reputation as one of the premier computer
            organizations in Mumbai specializing in repairs and building high quality custom-built new PCs.</p>
          <p>Our team of highly qualified field engineers help us maintain our reputation in these fields. They also
            provide the customer with sound technical knowledge, so as to enable the customer to sort small problems by
            themselves.</p>
          <p>Our office & workshop is situated at ideal location in Byculla (E), equidistant from Byculla & Mahalaxmi
            railway station. Also all buses to north & south of Mumbai pass through this point. Hence dispatching
            engineers, call-coordination to anywhere in Mumbai becomes very efficient & convenient. We have a call
            co-ordinator which supports & direct all field engineers.</p>

          <h4>Where we are now?</h4>
          <p>Servicing is still one of our goals, but our primary focus is now on providing the consumer with
            high-quality computing goods, as quickly and easily as possible. After the retirement of partners & closure
            of Leo Infotech, the business is now run under new name LEO INFORMATIQUE from our office at 505 Veena
            Killedar Industrial Estate, Byculla (W), Mumbai. Sales and maintenance is one of our highest priorities and
            we have a number of staff completely dedicated to this task . We have found the most effective way of
            providing fast service to minimize the down time.</p>
